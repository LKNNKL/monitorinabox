# icinga2-master/tasks/main.yml
#
# This role transforms an icinga2_base system into one that implements
# the Icinga master functionalities. Namely listening for satellites to connect
# and providing a collection point for the metrics reported from satellites. This
# role creates the Icinga public key infrastructure including all keys and
# certificates that ensure encrypted and authenticated communication between the
# master and all satellites. 
#
# We intend for the Icinga master to be installed on its own dedicated system
# because it change system-wide configuration that will conflict with other
# services e.g. firewall rules, running on the same host.
